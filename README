1. Add the file Dataflow.h to the directory include/llvm/Analysis
2. Add the following lines to the file lib/Transforms/CMakeLists.txt
    add_directory(Liveness)
    add_directory(Reaching)
    add_directory(Maypoint)
3. Copy the three directories in this folder to lib/Transforms
4. Run make in the directory lib/Transforms

To run a pass use the following command
 ./opt -load ../lib/LLVMMaypoint.dylib -Maypoint < <bc_file>
 ./opt -load ../lib/LLVMLiveness.dylib -Liveness < <bc_file>
 ./opt -load ../lib/LLVMReaching.dylib -Reaching < <bc_file>
